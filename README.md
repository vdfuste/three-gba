# Three GBA
A quick 3D project with Three.js I'm doing on my free time just for fun.

Chech it out [here](https://three-gba.vercel.app)

I wanted to create a Game Boy Advance case picker implementing different animations based on the user's actions.

This project is under development and I'm still trying to figure how to do an specific transition programatically, but I think it's looking good, though.
